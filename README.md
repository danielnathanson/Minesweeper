# Minesweeper

This is a clone of the popular game, Minesweeper, that I created in my freshman year of college (2021).
This game can be played simply by running the minesweeper_game.py file.

PySimpleGUI must be installed in order to play.
The game can be played normally or a checkbox can be clicked on the GUI to have an AI play the game.
Play the game by running the file from the command line with one argument, 'normal' or 'analysis', to specify which mode you want to play on
