# Minesweeper

This is a clone of the popular game, Minesweeper, that I created in my freshman year of college (2021).
This game can be played simply by running the minesweeper_game.py file.

PySimpleGUI must be installed in order to play.
The game can be played normally (as a human player or AI) or in analysis mode.
Play the game by running the file from the command line with \*normal\* OR \*analysis \<width\> \<height\> \<mine_count\> \<num_games\>\* provided as command line arguments to specify which mode you want to play on
