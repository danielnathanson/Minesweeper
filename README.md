# Minesweeper

This is a clone of the popular game, Minesweeper, that I created in my freshman year of college (2021).
This game can be played simply by running the minesweeper_game.py file.

The game can be played normally or a checkbox can be clicked on the GUI to have an AI play the game.
By commenting and uncommenting two lines of code at the end of the file, the win percentage of the AI can be tested
at specified dimensions and bomb count.
